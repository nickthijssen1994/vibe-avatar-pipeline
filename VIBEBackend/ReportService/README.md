# ReportService

This service was added to be able to retrieve results from a specific analysis and format them to a more human friendly
format. Because different algorithms produces results in al kinds of formats and save them in different file types, this
service provides a way of unifying all the raw data. Currently, it is only able to read the results from the OpenFace
algorithm which is stored in a CSV file, but in the future it can be extended depending on which algorithms are added to
the project.
